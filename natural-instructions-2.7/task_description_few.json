    "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context. You have to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from a context into a summary while answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. Yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. Typically, the choices are either yes or no.",

    "In this task, you will be shown a conversation and a question. You should categorize the question into matching, summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense groups. Matching is a question entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in a dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category. We further define summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense subcategories. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of dialogue, such as the topic of dialogue and the relation between speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer logical questions. in arithmetic questions Inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer commonsense questions, besides the textual information in the dialogue, we also require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group. \"W\" and \"M\" in the conversations stand for \"woman\" and \"man\".",

    "You are supposed to identify the category of a high-school level math question. There are five possible categories (1) algebra (2) arithmetic (3) measurement (4) numbers, and (5) probability. Use the following guidelines: (1) 'algebra' questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable (2) 'arithmetic' questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets (3) 'measurement' questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit (4) 'numbers' questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM etc. (5) 'probability' questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category.",
    "This task involves annotating the answer type to a given question that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning). Note that the questions require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. There are 3 possible answer types (i) spans, (ii) numbers and (iii) dates. If the answer can be found in the passage, label it as \"span\". If the answer is a number, label as \"number\". Similarly, label \"date\" if you think the answer to the given question is a date.",
    "Indicate with `Yes` if the given question involves the provided reasoning `Category`. Indicate with `No`, otherwise. We define five categories of temporal reasoning. First: \"event duration\" which is defined as the understanding of how long events last. For example, \"brushing teeth\", usually takes few minutes. Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events. This category is based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not. For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: \"event ordering\" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\". The fourth one is \"absolute timepoint\". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.",

You can think about it like this: If the question was in another language, knowing the meaning of which words were necessary and enough for you to understand the question and answer it?. If your answer consists of multiple spans of words from the question, separate those using a comma (\", \"). Do not generate any word that is not present in the question. Make sure that your response is contained in the given question and the words are in the same order as the question.\n Grammatical correctness is not important.",
    "You are given a question. You need to detect which category better describes the question. A question belongs to the description category if it asks about description and abstract concepts. Entity questions are about entities such as animals, colors, sports, etc. Abbreviation questions ask about abbreviations and expressions abbreviated. Questions regarding human beings, description of a person, and a group or organization of persons are categorized as Human. Quantity questions are asking about numeric values and Location questions ask about locations, cities, and countries. Answer with \"Description\", \"Entity\", \"Abbreviation\", \"Person\", \"Quantity\", and \"Location\".",
    "In this task, you need to indicate the presence of temporal reasoning in the provided question. Questions that involve temporal reasoning/understanding contain one of the following five temporal phenomena: First: \"event duration\", is defined as the understanding of how long events last (e.g.,\"brushing teeth\" usually takes a few minutes). Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events, which are based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not (e.g., \"being born in the U.S.\" is a stationary event since it will last forever; \"being hungry\" is a transient event since it lasts for a short period of time). Third: \"event ordering\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\"). Fourth: \"absolute timepoint\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \"going to school\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M).
