Matching is a question entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in a dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category. We further define summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense subcategories. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of dialogue, such as the topic of dialogue and the relation between speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer logical questions. in arithmetic questions Inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer commonsense questions, besides the textual information in the dialogue, we also require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group. \"W\" and \"M\" in the conversations stand for \"woman\" and \"man\".",

    "Indicate with `Yes` if the given question involves the provided reasoning `Category`. Indicate with `No`, otherwise. We define five categories of temporal reasoning. First: \"event duration\" which is defined as the understanding of how long events last. For example, \"brushing teeth\", usually takes few minutes. Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events. This category is based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not. For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: \"event ordering\" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\". The fourth one is \"absolute timepoint\". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.",

You can think about it like this: If the question was in another language, knowing the meaning of which words were necessary and enough for you to understand the question and answer it?. If your answer consists of multiple spans of words from the question, separate those using a comma (\", \"). Do not generate any word that is not present in the question. Make sure that your response is contained in the given question and the words are in the same order as the question.\n Grammatical correctness is not important.",
    "You are given a question. You need to detect which category better describes the question. A question belongs to the description category if it asks about description and abstract concepts. Entity questions are about entities such as animals, colors, sports, etc. Abbreviation questions ask about abbreviations and expressions abbreviated. Questions regarding human beings, description of a person, and a group or organization of persons are categorized as Human. Quantity questions are asking about numeric values and Location questions ask about locations, cities, and countries.

    "In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by.

    "Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.",

  "Question Decomposition": [
    "In the following task, you are given a yes/no question, its answer, and additional information which includes a description of a key term in the question and several facts. Your task is to \"decompose the question\"i.e. write the steps required to construct the given answer where each step is a question that can be answered using Wikipedia articles. To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \"not_definitive_answer\" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\"incorrect_answer\" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.",
    "In this task you will break down a question into the basic steps required to answer it.\n A question decomposition is a numbered list of operations that must be performed to answer the original question. Imagine explaining your question to a friendly droid by listing each action it should take in order for the question to be answered. Each step in our decomposition should refer to either an entity (known or unknown), a propery of an entity or a query operation (count, group, union, etc.)\n Here are the list of step templates and their description:\n Select: A select step is used to return a set of objects. There are no references to previous steps in a select step. template: Return [attributes]\n Filter: A filter step is used to return results from a previous step to which a certain condition applies. template: Return [#step] [condition]\n Project: A project step should return certain attributes of the results of a previous step. template: Return [attributes] of [#step]\n Aggregate: An aggregate step returns an aggregator function applied on a step's result. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step].\n Group: A group step is an aggregator applied on attributes. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step] for each [attribute]\n Superlative: A superlative step is used to return the result with a highest/lowest attribute among other results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [is] [highest / lowest]\n Comparative: A comparative step is used when we need to compare an attribute with a number to filter results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [comparator] [number] \n Union: A union step is used to return results of two steps together. template: Return [#step1] [or / ,] [#step2]\n Intersection: An intersection step returns the result that two steps have in common. template: Return [attribute] of both [#step1] and [#step2]\n Discard: A discard step returns result of a step and excludes result of another step from it. template: Return [#step1] besides [#step2]\n Sort: A sort returns result of another step in a specific order. template: Return [#step1] [ordered / sorted by] [#step2]\n Is true: An is true step checks a condition on another result and returns a true or false. template: Return [is / if] [condition]\n Arithmetic: An arithmatic step operates an arithmatic operation on one or more steps. template: Return the [arithmetic op.] of [#step1] [and] [#step2]."
